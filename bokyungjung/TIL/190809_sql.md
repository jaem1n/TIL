        WHERE w2.recorddate = DATE_ADD(w1.recorddate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
        AND w1.temperature < w2.temperature;

    ```sql
        SELECT w2.id AS ID

        LEFT JOIN weather AS w2 ON w2.recorddate=DATE_ADD(w1.recorddate, INTERVAL 1 DAY)
        # INNER JOIN을 써도 상관 없음 -> 어차피 WHERE절에서 비교하는 조건이 들어가기 때문에
        # (INNER JOIN 속도가 더 빠르기도 함)
        WHERE w2.temperature > w1.temperature;
    ```
