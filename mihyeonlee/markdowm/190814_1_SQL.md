from students as s
inner join grades as g on (s.Marks >= g.Min_Mark and s.Marks <= g.Max_Mark)
order by g.grade desc, s.name asc
--------------------------------------
select if(g.grade >= 8, s.name, null),
g.grade, s.marks
from students as s
inner join grades as g on s.marks between min_mark and max_mark
order by g.grade desc, s.marks, n.name

### symmetric pairs

select a.X as X, a.Y as Y
from Functions as a
    inner join Functions as b on (a.X = b.Y and a.Y = b.X and a.X != b.X)
where a.X < a.Y 
union all 
select X, Y
from Functions 
where X = Y 
group by X, Y
having count(*) > 1
order by X, Y
